I am a final-year PhD student in the **Statistics Department** at the **University of Michigan** advised by **Ambuj Tewari**. Previously, I worked on recommendation systems and search engines as a machine learning engineer in the industry.

My research interests are broadly in design and analysis of algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty. I have worked on problems including non-stationary bandits, offline reinforcement learning, constrained reinforcement learning.


Outside of work, I enjoy running and playing the piano.
